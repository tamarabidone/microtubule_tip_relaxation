## Molecular dynamics trajectories and their analysis after mapping to a coarse-grained representation

![Naming scheme](./naming_scheme.png)

All-atom molecular dynamics trajectories mapped to coarse-grained monomer-resolution representation are stored at google drive and can be accessed via links in `gdp-mt.url` and `gtp-mt.url`. The order of beads is as ollws:
